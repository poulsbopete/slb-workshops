    Open the **Session slides** tab for today's deck while your Observability Serverless project provisions (~2–3 minutes).
    
    When provisioning finishes, switch to **Elastic Serverless** for the hands-on lab.

> **Lab environment:** Use the **Elastic Serverless** tab only. Hands-on steps run on **Observability Serverless** with **pre-loaded SLB sample data** (logs, metrics, traces, alert rules, and an SLO). The **same observability capabilities** apply on **ECH** and **self-managed**; Serverless mainly saves platform management. Steps are copy/paste in Kibana — no terminal required.

# AI-Assisted Investigation & Automated Response

## Part 1 — AI Assistant

1. Open **AI Assistant** from Observability.
2. Ask: *What services had the highest error rate in the last hour?*
3. Follow up: *Show correlated logs and traces.*

## Part 2 — Agent Builder

1. Open **Agents** in the sidebar.
2. Explore prebuilt agents or create a simple investigation agent.
3. Connect it to observability context (facilitator demo).

## Part 3 — From alert to root cause

1. Open an active alert → **Investigate in APM / Logs**.
2. Correlate logs, metrics, and traces for one incident.

Click **Check**.
