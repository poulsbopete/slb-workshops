# Intro to Elastic — Hands-on Lab

Welcome to your personal **Elastic Observability Serverless** project. This lab
supports the **F-02 — Intro to Elastic** live session.

## Part 1 — Platform tour

1. Open the **Elastic Serverless** tab (Kibana Home).
2. Navigate **Observability → Overview**. Note the unified view of logs, metrics, and traces.
3. Open **Stack Management → Index Management**. Observe data streams created by the platform.
4. Open **Stack Management → Data tiers**. Review hot / warm / cold / frozen / delete concepts
   from the session.

## Part 2 — Persona lenses

Pick the lens closest to your role:

| Persona | Start here |
|---------|------------|
| Developer | **Observability → APM → Services** |
| SRE / Infra | **Observability → Hosts** and **Fleet** |
| Analyst | **Analytics → Discover** |
| Architect | **Stack Management → Index Lifecycle Policies** |

## Part 3 — SLB context

Discuss with your facilitator: which of these building blocks map to your current
Grafana / Prometheus / OTel workflows today?

When finished, click **Check**.
